          "In Los Angeles, three guys with limited social lives hatch a plan to meet women: they'll issue a casting call for an independent film, interview actresses, and ask out the ones who interest them. Glenn is a nerd, but he has the office. Sherman has the idea--he's a hound, happy to lie, eager to meet and bed as many women as he can fool. Ritchie, who owns the camera, hopes to meet his true love. Within a few days, he's fallen for Marina Dell, new in town with a boyfriend back East; Glenn is gaga for Laurel, and Sherman can't say no to the adventurous Nikita. How long can they sustain the fiction, and what about real feelings?—",

          'Following the success of his television biography The Naked Civil Servant (1975), Quentin Crisp (Sir John Hurt) is invited to America to lecture on How To Be Happy, and falls in love with New York City\'s more permissive ambiance. Agent Connie Clausen (Swoosie Kurtz) enables him to be a "resident alien", writing movie reviews and dispensing words of wisdom. Curious about but impervious to trends, he describes A.I.D.S. as a "fad, nothing more", actually to divert heterosexual anger, but he is misinterpreted and reviled by many gays. A return to popularity occurs when he helps Patrick Angus (Jonathan Tucker), a young, A.I.D.S.-afflicted artist attain fame for his paintings and his healthy cynicism is marketed by performance artist Penny Arcade (Cynthia Nixon), putting him back in the limelight. Poor health causes him to refuse a lecture tour of England, but he gives a triumphant final audience at a gay club in Tampa.

          "Upon reaching the train station to death, a dejected soul is informed that he is 'lucky' and will have another chance at life though he does not want it. He is placed in the body of a 14-year-old boy named Makoto Kobayashi, who has just committed suicide by an overdose of pills. Watched over by a neutral spirit named Purapura in the form of a little boy, the soul must figure out what his greatest sin and mistake in his former life was before his six-month time limit in Makoto's body runs out. He also has a number of other lesser duties he must complete, such as understanding what led Makoto to commit suicide in the first place and learning how to enjoy his second chance at life.\nHe finds Makoto did not like his family and he greatly dislikes them for the same reasons. He is contemptuous of his father who is an underdog at work, forced to work lots of unpaid overtime. Despite her efforts, he hates his mother who had an affair with a dance instructor, something his father seems to be oblivious of. His older brother Mitsuru has given up on him because he is too moody and has no friends at school or anywhere else. He discovers that a girl (Hiroka) he fancies sells sex to older men so she can have the clothes and things she wants. Shoko is a weird girl from Makoto's class who becomes suspicious of his unusual behavior so he tries to stay away from her. After he gets mugged and beaten up by some delinquents, Shoko comes to visit Makoto at his house, but he scares her off. In one of their subsequent encounters Purapura explains that Makoto will really die this time after his six months expire. However, when he befriends Saotome, a boy in his class who accepts outcasts such as him and treats them as equals, Makoto sees the joy in life for the first time. They spend some time together and they even begin studying for their high school entrance exam, something for which neither of them had any ambition before.\nKnowing that his brother will never get accepted to a public high school due to his failing grades and lack of interest, Mitsuru announces that he will postpone his college entrance exams in order to allow his parents to save some money so they can send Makoto to a private school. Makoto refuses and tells his parents and brother that he has already chosen Tamegawa High (a public school he and Saotome agreed on earlier). An aggravated Mitsuru is unable to comprehend his unwillingness to accept his family's help and asks him if he enjoys tormenting his own family. Makoto breaks in tears and says that he just wanted to go to the same school his only friend is going to apply which leads to his parents accepting his wish. With his deadline reaching its end, Makoto meets with Purapura for one last time. He announces that he has found out what his former life's mistake was. He reveals that the soul was Makoto to begin with and that the mistake was his suicide. Purapura tells him that he will keep on living, but that he will also erase his memories of Purapura and the spirit world in order to make Makoto not think that he has any more chances. Before wiping his memories, Purapura advises him to live a colorful life.",

        summary:
          "It's late 1995 in the Notre-Dame-de-Grâce (NDG) neighborhood of Montréal. In being a gossip, landlady Mme. Gauthier makes it a point to get to know the business of the tenants in her older four story walk-up apartment building. Third floor tenant Louise, whose life revolves around her two cats, Mozart and Tia Maria, and who has somewhat retreated from life otherwise, works as a waitress in a neighborhood Chinese-Canadian restaurant. Beyond her cats, she is fixated on the yet unsolved serial murders in NDG of young women, who are raped before their throats are slit. Spencer, who lives on the second floor, is at the moment largely confined to his apartment as he has been in a wheelchair ever since the car accident last year that claimed the life of his wife. His doctors believe that he will eventually walk again. He keeps himself busy by tending to the several elaborate aquariums in his apartment. While Louise and Spencer are friends, Mme. Gauthier and Spencer's physical therapist Miss Van Ilen would like to see that friendship blossom into romance. Extremely loud and angry Francophone Valérie, who lives in the building with her often \"away-on-'business'\" husband in their marital discord, is the bane of everyone else's existence in the building, while they are the bane of hers, Mozart and Tia Maria getting into the garbage cans outside her window on the fire escape which is her most vocal current complaint. Having just moved into a top floor unit after a stint in China, socially awkward Victor, an elementary school teacher, does whatever he can to befriend Spencer and especially Louise, his attempts playing on what he believes is their most basic needs/wants. This combination of people and situations ends up being deadly, which may or may not be related to the serial murders. Individual self-preservation may take over in each person trying to keep his or her own fundamental secret.—Huggo",

        summary:
          "Growing up on Staten Island, filmmakers Joshua Zeman and Barbara Brancaccio had often heard the urban legend of \"Cropsey.\" It was a cautionary tale invented to keep them out of the abandoned buildings that remained of the Willowbrook Mental Institution. Cropsey was supposedly an escaped patient who would come out late at night and snatch children off the streetssometimes with a hook for a hand, other times with a bloody ax. But in 1987, Jennifer Schweiger, a 13-year-old with Down syndrome, disappeared from their community. For Zeman, Brancaccio, and the other kids of Staten Island, their urban legend became real. Even as adults, this real-life boogeyman hasn't escaped the minds of the filmmakers. The eeriness of the mystery pulsates through the film as they journey into the underbelly of their borough to investigate not just Schweiger's disappearance but four other missing children linked to a shadowy drifter named Andre Rand. As more information and clues unravel, Zeman and Brancaccio become more immersed in shocking surprises and revelations. The reality they uncover in this uniquely hair-raising documentary is more terrifying than any urban legend. --David Kwok, Tribeca Film Festival",
